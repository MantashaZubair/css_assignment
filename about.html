            First, the following quote shows how fast food is becoming more
            accessible to people. “ In 1970, Martinsburg had six fast-food
            restaurants; today it has more than forty.” (McJobs by Eric
            Schlosser and Charles Wilson) This supports my claim because it
            shows how fast food has become more accessible to all people and
            this is good because fast food is a valuable source of food for some
            people. The fact that more than a third of american kids eat fast
            food every day proves that. (newsweek) Second, the following quote
            shows that fast food companies produce consistent and inexpensive
            food for people. “The strict rules at fast-food restaurants help to
            create food that always tastes the same. They help

            A <b><i>kitchen</i></b> is a room or part of a room used for cooking
            and food preparation in a dwelling or in a commercial establishment.
            A modern middle-class residential kitchen is typically equipped with
            a stove, a sink with hot and cold running water, a refrigerator, and
            worktops and kitchen cabinets arranged according to a modular
            design. Many households have a microwave oven, a dishwasher, and
            other electric appliances. The main functions of a kitchen are to
            store, prepare and cook food (and to complete related tasks such as
            dishwashing). The room or area may also be used for dining (or small
            meals such as breakfast), entertaining and laundry. The design and
            construction of kitchens is a huge market all over the world.

            <b><i> Lounges</i></b> have been around for quite some time. In
            fact, people have been lounging around in rooms specifically meant
            for people to relax and just chill out in since ancient times! More
            recently, however, big cities like Madrid, Barcelona, Paris, and
            London have incorporated specific lounge areas into their bars,
            hotels, and restaurants in an effort to invite a more subdued crowd
            that might want to relax and have just a small drink or a snack.
            This is what we call the lounge area. Lounges tend to attract the
            after-work crowd, seeking a calmer environment where dancing isn’t a
            necessity.

            While the <b><i>bar or pub</i></b> environment tends to be crowded, messier, with
            little attention to décor. A pub or a bar might just serve alcohol
            to its patrons, and provide loud live music – a rowdy environment
            indeed! A lounge, on the other hand, may or may not serve food. The
            lounge may have an extensive drink menu that sets it apart from the
            often-sleazy pub or bar atmosphere. In fact, the cocktail is often
            served up in a lounge environment. Sure, many places that serve
            cocktails are often called “cocktail bars,” but step foot in almost
            any cocktail bar and you will immediately feel as if you are not in
            a typical bar!
