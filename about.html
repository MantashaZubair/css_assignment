          Lorem ipsum is a placeholder text commonly used to demonstrate the
          visual form of a document or a typeface without relying on meaningful
          content. Lorem ipsum may be used as a placeholder before final copy is
          available. It is also used to temporarily replace text in a process
          called greeking, which allows designers to consider the form of a
          webpage or publication, without the meaning of the text influencing
          the design. Lorem ipsum is typically a corrupted version of De finibus
          bonorum et malorum, a 1st-century BC text by the Roman statesman and
          philosopher Cicero, with words altered, added, and removed to make it
          nonsensical and improper Latin. Versions of the Lorem ipsum text have
          been used in typesetting at least since the 1960s, when it was
          popularized by advertisements for Letraset transfer sheets.[1] Lorem
          ipsum was introduced to the digital world in the mid-1980s, when Aldus
          employed it in graphic and word-processing templates for its desktop
          publishing program PageMaker. Other popular word processors, including
          Pages and Microsoft Word, have since adopted Lorem ipsum,[2] as have
          many LaTeX packages,[3][4][5] web content managers such as Joomla! and
          WordPress, and CSS libraries such as Semantic UI.[6]Lorem ipsum is a
